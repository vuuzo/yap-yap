## Guess who’s back, back again

First of all, we apologize to be gone for so long. We didn’t really have the time to work on stuff lately, so we had to pause BarMates for a while.

## New Staff!

Anyways, we are now back again. With a new co-founder, Eljas Puhakka we are ready to continue the business.

## New website!

Regarding other stuff, I, [Oscar](https://www.github.com/vuuzo), have been reworking the page. We now got this fancy blog, and on top of that, I am busy designing the catalogue page.s

## New stuff?

We are working hard on our products and are excited to launch them for you soon, expectedly within this year.

‘Til then, have a nice one!
