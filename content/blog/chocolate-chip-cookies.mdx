# Ultimate Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies

## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients

- **2 1/4 cups (280g) all-purpose flour**
- **1/2 teaspoon baking soda**
- **1/2 teaspoon baking powder**
- **1/2 teaspoon salt**

### Wet Ingredients

- **3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled**
- **1 cup (200g) packed brown sugar**
- **1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar**
- **1 large egg + 1 egg yolk**
- **2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract**
- **1 teaspoon molasses** (optional, for extra chewiness)

### Mix-Ins

- **1 1/2 cups (270g) semi-sweet chocolate chips or chunks**
- **1/2 cup (100g) chopped nuts** (optional)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Dry Ingredients

In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt until fully combined. Set aside.

### Step 2: Blend Wet Ingredients

In a large bowl, combine the melted butter with both sugars (brown and granulated). Use a whisk or electric mixer on medium speed until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2-3 minutes.

### Step 3: Add Eggs and Flavorings

Add the egg, egg yolk, vanilla extract, and molasses (if using) to the butter-sugar mixture. Mix until fully incorporated and the batter is glossy.

### Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients

Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Mix until just combined. Do not overmix, as this can make the cookies tough.

### Step 5: Fold in Chocolate and Nuts

Using a spatula, gently fold in the chocolate chips or chunks, and nuts if you're using them, until evenly distributed.

### Step 6: Chill the Dough

Cover the dough with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or up to 48 hours. Chilling is crucial for flavor development and preventing the cookies from spreading too much.

### Step 7: Preheat the Oven

Preheat your oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.

### Step 8: Shape the Cookies

Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. If you prefer, roll the dough into balls for more uniform cookies.

### Step 9: Bake

Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden but the centers are still soft and slightly underbaked. They will continue to cook on the baking sheet after removal from the oven.

### Step 10: Cool

Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Tips for Perfect Cookies

- **Measuring Flour**: Ensure you measure your flour correctly by spooning it into the measuring cup and leveling it off with a knife. Too much flour can make the cookies dry.
- **Butter Temperature**: Make sure your melted butter is not too hot when mixing with the sugar, or it may cause the sugars to dissolve too much, leading to greasy cookies.
- **Baking Time**: The key to chewy cookies is not overbaking. The cookies should look slightly underdone when you remove them from the oven.

## Storage

Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week. You can also freeze the dough balls before baking for up to 3 months. Bake from frozen, adding a couple of extra minutes to the baking time.
