`clip-path` is often used for trimming a DOM node into specific shapes, like triangles. But what if I told you that it's also great for animations?

In this article, we'll dive into `clip-path` and explore some of the cool things you can do with it. Once you read it, you'll start seeing this CSS property being used everywhere.

## The Basics

The `clip-path` property is used to clip an element into a specific shape. We create a clipping region with it, content outside of this region will be hidden, while content inside will be visible. This allows us to easily turn a rectangle into a circle for example.

```css
.circle {
  clip-path: circle(50% at 50% 50%);
}
```

This has no effect on layout meaning that an element with `clip-path` will occupy the same space as an element without it, just like `transform`.

## Positioning

We positioned our circle above using a coordinate system. It starts at the top left corner (0, 0). `circle(50% at 50% 50%)` means that the circle will have a border radius of 50% and will be positioned at 50% from the top and 50% from the left, which is the center of the element.

There are other values like `ellipse`, `polygon`, or even `url()` which allows us to use a custom SVG as the clipping path, but we are going to focus on `inset` as that's what we'll be using for all animations in this post.

The inset values define the top, right, bottom, and left offsets of a rectangle. This means that if we use `inset(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%)`, or `inset(100%)` as a shortcut, we are "hiding" (clipping) the whole element. An inset of `(0px 50% 0px 0px)` would make the left half of the element invisible, and so on.
