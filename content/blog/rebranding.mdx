## New font

I, [vuuzo](https://www.github.com/vuuzo "vuuzo's GitHub"), the head of design, have been thinking about our design decisions. For a long time, we had the “boring” _Montserrat_ font as our branding font, which I didn&apos;t find very pleasing and playful, so I went out and looked for another one. Now, we have this playful font called _Grandstander_.

I myself really like this font since it looks playful, is readable and looks a bit more interesting than _Montserrat_ because it is a bit more twirky and looks handwritten.

Regarding color scheme, I don&apos;t really see us rewriting it, since I pretty much like the colors, but if you have recommendations or are a colorist (does that exist?) yourself, feel free to contact us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/oooscc).

## Store

Otherwise I have been actively working on our web store, the progress, if you&apos;re a developer and interested, you can see [here](https://www.x.com/vvuuzo).

That&apos;s it for this one. Have a nice one, don&apos;t stop grinding and stay fit!
